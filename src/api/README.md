## What is this folder for?

This folder is for holding all the request your client application will make to the APIs.

In this folder you should create files and export functions to make API calls.

You can use the `Axios` library to make the requests.

For instance the `users.js` file exports a function called `fetchLoggedInUser` that emulates a HTTP request, that function returns a promise.
