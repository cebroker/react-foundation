## What is this folder for?

This folder is for holding all the containers.

A container is component that connect itself to the `Redux store` and then pass the props it gets from the store to the components that we can find in the `components` folder.

For instance the `App` folder contains all the necessary files to make an `App container`, connect it to the `Redux store` and then pass the necessary props to the children components.
